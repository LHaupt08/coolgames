    <h1>An Introduction</h1>

    <p style="clear:both; margin: 5px 25px 5px 5px;">I am Lukas. I've been into video games since the age of around 5, and have primarily used Nintendo consoles (ha, Nintendo baby) throughout my (somewhat short) life.</p>

    <p>We had a Wii when I was born, but I did not really care about it at the time. However, I do have memories of watching my brother and dad playing <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Wii Play</a> (the tanks minigame). I recall watching my brother beat the 20th level (a feat I have yet to surpass!) during those times.</p>

    <p style="clear:both;">Around my fifth or sixth birthday, one of my presents was <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Super Smash Bros Brawl.</a> While it’s not exactly a popular game in the series, it was the game that got me into, well, gaming. The Wii is still a console I play on to this day, playing <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Skylanders</a>, <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Fishing Resort</a>, <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Speed Racer</a>, the Wii version of <a href="#">Go Vacation</a>, and the <a href="#" title="page does not exist, but if it did it would be linked here :]">Wii</a>-branded games.</p>

    <p>About 6-7 years ago, I got a Wii U (which I love, even though I don’t have a lot of games for it), and around 2021, I bought a Switch. I don’t have a particular favorite or least favorite, as all of them have made me happy. Despite their crappy business practices, thanks, Nintendo.</p>
